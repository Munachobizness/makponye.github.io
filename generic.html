							<p>Persistent and process driven student with a bachelor's degree in Information Science &
								Technology and a minor in Business. I have a collegiate level of understanding in coding with experience in
								HTML, CSS, JS, R & Python. I'm also a patient and quick learner who is a naturally outgoing person with great social
								and communication skills and will shine in collaborative work sometimes taking on the role of the leader. </p>
							<p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Arizona. 
								I came into the school of Social and Behavioral Sciences knowing exactly what I wanted to do because of my love for technology.
								Technology has been a big part of my life because when I was young I did not have that much access to it. 
								When I was first introduced to technology, I knew in the future I would like to be a part of the community that helps develop it. 
								My curiosity in learning about the information of technology has led me to explore platforms such as 
								Microsoft and Adobe and utilize them to create multiple projects including Webpages, A Podcast, A Video Score and a 2D and 3D game. 
								I have also volunteered in a few activities that have fed my curiosity with more knowledge about information science and technology.</p>
